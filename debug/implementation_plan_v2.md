# Drug Pipeline Implementation Plan v2

**Created:** Nov 27, 2025  
**Updated:** Dec 12, 2025  
**Objective:** Unified drug tagging with consistent algorithms for Annex F and ESOA

> **IMPORTANT:** After every group of changes, update both `pipeline.md` (algorithmic logic) and this file (implementation status).

---

## Current State Summary (Dec 4, 2025)

| Metric | Current | Target |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Annex F tagging | 86.6% ATC, 69.3% DrugBank | Maximize taggable |
| ESOA ATC tagging | 67.0% | 95%+ |
| ESOA→Drug Code | **34.8%** | 60%+ |

### Part 4 Improvement Summary
- **Initial:** 1.5% (zero tolerance, no parsing)
- **Final:** 34.8% (dose parsing, combo handling, form equivalence, strict dose matching)
- **Key fixes:**
  - Vial size parsing: `250|MG|1|G` → 250mg (not 1250mg combo)
  - Strict dose requirement: No fallback when dose missing
  - Bare number assumption: "275" → 275mg
- **Remaining:** 46.0% `generic_not_in_annex` (confirmed: 99.57% genuinely not in Annex F)

---

## All 34 TODOs

### Phase 1: Analysis

#### #9. Research Unknown Acronyms ✅ DONE
**What:** Google/research: NEBS, GTTS, SOLN, SUSP, and compile complete form abbreviation list.

**Completed (Nov 28, 2025):** All abbreviations added to `unified_constants.py`:
- NEBS → NEBULE (added)
- GTTS → DROPS (already in)
- SOLN → SOLUTION (already in)
- SUSP → SUSPENSION (already in)

---

#### #22. Compile and Externalize Hardcoded Data ✅ DONE
**What:** Consolidate all hardcoded token lists into a single unified constants file. Deduplicate across active scripts and `debug/old_files/`.

**Completed (Nov 28, 2025):** Created `pipelines/drugs/scripts/tagging/unified_constants.py` with:
- 119 stopwords, 69 salt tokens, 60 pure salt compounds
- 119 form mappings, 46 route mappings, 72 form-to-route mappings
- 7 form equivalence groups, 26 ATC combination patterns, 26 unit tokens
- Helper functions: is_stopword, is_salt_token, is_combination_atc, etc.
- Refactored imports in constants.py, text_utils_drugs.py, routes_forms_drugs.py, scoring.py

**Target:** Create `pipelines/drugs/scripts/tagging/unified_constants.py` containing all token sets, then refactor all scripts to import from there.

**Conceptual categories (deduplicated):**

| Category | Variables to Merge | Est. Unique Items |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------|

| **CONNECTIVES** | `CONNECTIVE_WORDS`, `_SALT_TAIL_BREAK_TOKENS` | ~8 |
| **SCORING_WEIGHTS** | `PRIMARY_WEIGHTS` (2 copies), `SECONDARY_WEIGHTS` (2 copies) | keep in scoring.py |
| **SYNONYMS** | `hardcoded` in lookup.py | move to unified synonyms dataset |
| **DESCRIPTOR_VALUES** | `_DESCRIPTOR_VALUES` | ~10 |

**Sources (active + old_files):**

*Active scripts:*
- `combos_drugs.py`, `text_utils_drugs.py`, `generic_normalization.py`
- `routes_forms_drugs.py`, `dose_drugs.py`, `resolve_unknowns_drugs.py`
- `tagging/constants.py`, `tagging/scoring.py`, `tagging/lookup.py`

*Old files (recover useful terms):*
- `match_annex_f_with_atc.py` - `COMPOUND_GENERICS`, `COMBINATION_ATC_*`
- `unified_tagger.py` - duplicate constants
- `pnf_aliases_drugs.py` - `SALT_FORM_SUFFIXES`
- `run_drugs_pt_0_create_master_dataset.py` - `_FORM_MAP`, `_ROUTE_MAP`, `_SALT_MAP`, `_DESCRIPTOR_VALUES`
- `run_drugs_pt_1_detect_annex_f.py` - `_FORM_MAP`, `_ROUTE_MAP`, `_SALT_MAP`
- `run_drugs_pt_1_parse_annex_f.py` - `_GENERIC_NOISE_PHRASES`
- `generate_route_form_mapping.py` - `FORM_CANON`, `ROUTE_CANON`
- `match_outputs_drugs.py` - `FRIENDLY_*_LABELS`, `_ABBREVIATION_LOOKUP`
- `match_esoa_with_annex_f.py` - `ESOA_FORM_CANON`

**Action:**
1. Create `unified_constants.py` with deduplicated sets for each category
2. Add loader functions: `get_stopwords()`, `get_salt_tokens()`, `get_form_canon()`, etc.
3. Refactor all active scripts to `from .tagging.unified_constants import ...`
4. Delete `combos_drugs.py` (only kept for `SALT_TOKENS`)
5. Keep regex patterns and scoring weights in their respective files (logic, not data)

---

#### #24. Review and Classify Pipeline Scripts ✅ PARTIAL
**What:** Audit all files in `./pipelines/drugs/scripts/`:
- Classify into folders (tagging, reference, utils, deprecated)
- Identify unused/legacy code
- Flag important logic NOT being used (report to user)

**Status (Nov 28, 2025):** Script audit completed. Moved 5 unused scripts to `debug/old_files/`:
- `aho_drugs.py` - Deprecated (using DuckDB)
- `debug_drugs.py` - References non-existent module
- `pnf_aliases_drugs.py` - Only used by deprecated aho_drugs.py
- `pnf_partial_drugs.py` - Not imported anywhere
- `generate_route_form_mapping.py` - One-time script

**Remaining:** Folder reorganization (tagging, reference, utils) - deferred to Phase 8 (Cleanup).

---

#### #25. Find Unknown Synonyms in Raw Data ✅ DONE
**What:** Extract all unique generic-like tokens from ESOA and Annex F, compare against unified synonyms, report gaps (potential synonyms we don't know about).

**Completed (Nov 28, 2025):** Analysis found 181 common unknowns:
- Added 15 missing salt tokens (ACETONIDE, BENZATHINE, CLAVULANATE, etc.)
- Added ~90 stopwords (ADULT, AQUEOUS, CHEWABLE, etc.) - refined to exclude drug components
- **CORRECTION:** Most "unknowns" were actually in DrugBank/WHO/PNF but analysis only checked `name` column
- Actual unknowns are **partial tokens from multi-word drug names** (e.g., MEFENAMIC from MEFENAMIC ACID)
- These should be handled by multi-word generic preservation (AGENTS.md #15), not synonyms

---

#### #26. DrugBank R Script Performance ✅ DONE
**What:** Profile `drugbank_generics.R` and related scripts. Check if:
- Over-parallelizing (too much overhead)
- Under-parallelizing (not using all cores)
- Not vectorized (row-by-row operations)

**Completed (Nov 28, 2025):** Already well-optimized:
- Parallel processing via `future`/`mclapply` with chunking
- `data.table` threading via `setDTthreads()`
- Configurable workers: `ESOA_DRUGBANK_WORKERS` env var (default 8)
- OS-aware backend: multicore on Unix, multisession on Windows
- No changes needed.

---

### Phase 2: Data Foundation

#### #0. Refresh All Base Datasets ✅ DONE
**What:** Run Part 1 to refresh all base datasets before proceeding with other Phase 2 work.

**Completed (Nov 28, 2025):**
- WHO ATC exports: 3.4s

---

#### DrugBank R Script Optimization ✅ DONE
**What:** Optimize DrugBank R scripts for faster execution when called from Python.

**Completed (Nov 28, 2025):**
- Created `_shared.R`: Common setup (packages, parallel backend, utilities)
- Removed `drugbank_all.R`: No longer needed, Python calls scripts directly
- Updated individual scripts to source `_shared.R` (guard prevents double-loading)
- Updated Python to use native shell (`os.system()`) with live spinner/timer
- Uses `cores - 1` workers, cross-platform support (Windows/macOS/Linux)

**Files:**
- `dependencies/drugbank_generics/_shared.R` (NEW)
- `dependencies/drugbank_generics/drugbank_*.R` (MODIFIED)
- `run_drugs_all.py` - `refresh_drugbank_generics_exports()` (MODIFIED)

---

#### #11. Expand Synonyms from DrugBank ✅ DONE
**What:** Extract synonyms where language=english, coder not empty, not iupac-only.

**Completed (Nov 28, 2025):** Already implemented in `drugbank_generics.R`:
- Lines 786-811 filter synonyms with `has_allowed & !only_iupac`
- Synonyms included in lexeme column, exploded to rows
- 7,345 generics with synonyms in generics_lookup.csv

---

#### #15. Data-Driven Route Inference ✅ DONE
**What:** Build form-route validity from PNF, DrugBank products, FDA.

**Completed (Nov 28, 2025):**
- `build_unified_reference.py` Step 2 extracts form-route combinations
- **form_route_validity.csv**: 53,039 combinations with source provenance

---

#### #16. Fix ESOA Row Binding ✅ DONE
**What:** Fix 44% duplicate rows in ESOA combined data.

**Completed (Nov 28, 2025):**
- Added `drop_duplicates()` to `_concatenate_csv()` in run_drugs_all.py
- 258,878 → 146,189 rows after deduplication
- Prints deduplication stats when run

---

#### #17. Build Proper Tier 1 Unified Reference ✅ DONE
**What:** Create unified reference with explosion logic.

**Completed (Nov 28, 2025):**
- **unified_drug_reference.csv**: 52,002 rows
- Exploded by: drugbank_id × atc_code × form × route
- Aggregated doses per combination
- Separate lookup tables: generics, brands, mixtures

---

#### #18. Collect All Known Doses ✅ DONE
**What:** Collect doses from all sources.

**Completed (Nov 28, 2025):**
- 28,230 rows have dose information (from DrugBank products)
- Aggregated as pipe-delimited in unified reference `doses` column
- Additional sources (PNF, WHO DDD, FDA) available for future enhancement

---

#### #28. Use DuckDB as Primary Data Store ✅ DONE
**What:** Use DuckDB for all data operations.

**Completed (Nov 28, 2025):**
- `build_unified_reference.py` uses in-memory DuckDB connection
- All source tables loaded into DuckDB with SQL queries
- Aggregation, joining, deduplication all done in SQL

---

#### #29. Enrich Unified Reference from DrugBank Products ✅ DONE
**What:** Extract dose/form/route from DrugBank products.

**Completed (Nov 28, 2025):**
- 455,970 products exported by R script
- Joined with generics in unified reference builder
- Brands extracted from products where is_generic=false

---

#### #35. Centralize Hardcoded Constants in DrugBank R Scripts (NEW)
**What:** The R scripts in `dependencies/drugbank_generics/` have hardcoded constants that duplicate our Python constants:

**drugbank_generics.R:**
- `PER_UNIT_MAP` (lines 390-404): 30+ unit abbreviation mappings (tab→tablet, ml, cap→capsule, etc.)
- Unit normalization patterns: microgram→mcg, milligram→mg, cc→ml, etc.

**drugbank_salts.R:**
- `salt_suffixes` (lines 98-115): 58 salt suffixes (HYDROCHLORIDE, SODIUM, SULFATE, etc.)
- `pure_salt_compounds` (lines 169-188): 51 pure salts (SODIUM CHLORIDE, etc.)

**drugbank_mixtures.R:**
- `SALT_SYNONYM_LOOKUP` (lines 281-288): Salt synonym mappings (hydrochloride↔hcl, sodium↔na, etc.)
- Excluded groups: "vet" (veterinary drugs)

**Action:**
1. Create `dependencies/drugbank_generics/constants.R` to centralize all hardcoded data
2. Export constants as CSV during R script run for Python sync
3. Add AGENTS.md rule to keep R and Python constants in sync

---

#### #32. Standardize Column Names Across Datasets ✅ DONE
**What:** Ensure consistent column names.

**Completed (Nov 28, 2025):**
- Unified reference uses: `drugbank_id`, `atc_code`, `generic_name`, `form`, `route`, `doses`, `sources`
- Generics lookup uses: `generic_name`, `drugbank_id`, `atc_code`, `source`, `canonical_name`
- Brands lookup uses: `brand_name`, `drugbank_id`, `generic_name`, `source`

---

### Phase 3: Core Matching

#### #1. Brand → Generic Swapping
**What:** Create a comprehensive brands lookup from 4 sources:
- `fda_drug_*$brand_name` (only if it doesn't match any known generic exactly - detect swapped rows)
- `drugbank$drugs$mixtures$name` → maps to `ingredients` delimited by "+"
- `drugbank$drugs$international_brands$brand`
- `drugbank$products$name` where `generic=='false'`

**Action:** Update `build_unified_reference.py` to consolidate all brand sources, then use in tagger to swap brands to generics before matching.

---

#### #2. Order-Independent Combination Matching
**What:** Modify matching logic to sort components alphabetically before comparison:
```python
sorted(["PIPERACILLIN", "TAZOBACTAM"]) == sorted(["TAZOBACTAM", "PIPERACILLIN"])
```

**Action:** Update `run_drugs_pt_4_esoa_to_annex_f.py` and `scoring.py` to normalize combo order.

---

#### #5. Permutation-Independent Component Matching
**What:** Same as #2 but specifically for vitamin combos like `B12 + B1 + B6`. Normalize by sorting components.

**Action:** Combined with #2 implementation.

---

#### #7. Synonym Swapping in Mixtures
**What:** When matching combos, normalize each component through synonyms first:
- `IPRATROPIUM + SALBUTAMOL` → `IPRATROPIUM + ALBUTEROL` (via synonym)

**Action:** Apply synonym normalization to each component before combo matching.

---

#### #27. Create Unified Tagger with Pharmaceutical Scoring
**What:** Create `pipelines/drugs/scripts/unified_tagger.py` as single entry point for both Annex F and ESOA tagging.

**Scoring based on pharmaceutical principles (deterministic, not numeric weights):**

1. **Generic Match** (REQUIRED for a valid match)
   - Must match the active ingredient(s)
   - Synonyms are equivalent (SALBUTAMOL = ALBUTEROL)
   - Order doesn't matter for combinations

2. **Salt Form** (IGNORED unless pure salt)
   - Salts are delivery mechanisms, not active ingredients
   - LOSARTAN POTASSIUM ≈ LOSARTAN (same drug)
   - Exception: Pure salts like SODIUM CHLORIDE, POTASSIUM CHLORIDE are the active compound

3. **Dose** (FLEXIBLE for ATC tagging, EXACT for Drug Code matching)
   - Same drug at different doses = same ATC
   - Different doses = different Drug Codes

4. **Form** (FLEXIBLE with equivalence groups)
   - TABLET ≈ CAPSULE (both oral solid)
   - AMPULE ≈ VIAL (both injectable)
   - SOLUTION ≈ SUSPENSION (both liquid)

5. **Route** (INFERRED from form if missing)
   - TABLET → ORAL
   - AMPULE → PARENTERAL
   - CREAM → TOPICAL

6. **ATC Preference** (for tie-breaking)
   - Single drug → prefer single-drug ATC (not combo ATC)
   - Combination → prefer combo ATC

**Output columns:** `atc_code`, `drugbank_id`, `generic_name`, `dose`, `form`, `route`, `type_detail`, `release_detail`, `form_detail`, `match_score`, `match_reason`

**Action:** Create new module that consolidates tagging logic with pharmaceutical-principled scoring.

---

### Phase 4: Enhancements

#### #3. Fuzzy Matching for Misspellings
**What:** Implement Levenshtein distance matching (1-2 char tolerance) as fallback when exact match fails. Use `rapidfuzz` library for speed.

**Action:** Add fuzzy matching layer in `tagger.py` after exact match fails.

---

#### #4. Compound Salt Recognition
**What:** Use `drugbank$salts` to identify that "SODIUM CHLORIDE" shares the anion "CHLORIDE" with other chloride salts, and map to base cation "SODIUM". Build anion→cation mapping.

**Action:** Enhance salt handling in `build_unified_reference.py` using `drugbank_salts_master.csv`.

---

#### #6. Type Detail Detection via Comma
**What:** Before stripping commas, capture text after comma as `type_detail` column:
- `"ALBUMIN, HUMAN"` → generic=`ALBUMIN`, type_detail=`HUMAN`
- `"ALCOHOL, ETHYL"` → generic=`ALCOHOL`, type_detail=`ETHYL`

**Action:** Add type_detail extraction in tokenizer.

---

#### #12. Capture Type Detail Before Comma Normalization
**What:** Same as #6 - extract type_detail from comma-separated text before normalizing.

**Action:** Combined with #6.

---

#### #13. Release Detail Column
**What:** If form contains comma and text after comma contains "release", capture as `release_detail`:
- `"TABLET, EXTENDED RELEASE"` → form=`TABLET`, release_detail=`EXTENDED RELEASE`

**Action:** Add to tokenizer/form extraction logic.

---

#### #14. Form Detail Column
**What:** Capture non-release modifiers after comma:
- `"TABLET, FILM COATED"` → form=`TABLET`, form_detail=`FILM COATED`

**Action:** Add alongside #13.

---

### Phase 5: Normalization

#### #34. Stop Word Filtering
**What:** Filter out unnecessary/noise words during tokenization that don't contribute to drug identification:
- `AS`, `IN`, `FOR`, `TO`, `WITH`, `EQUIV.`, `AND`, `OF`, `OR`, `NOT`, `THAN`, `HAS`, `DURING`, `THIS`, `W/`
- Exception: `PER` should be kept when indicating ingredient ratio (e.g., "10MG PER ML")

**Action:** Add stop word list to tokenizer, filter during text processing.

---

#### #8. Dose Denominator Normalization
**What:** Parse doses like `500MG/5ML` and normalize to per-1-unit: `100MG/ML`. Apply to all units.

**Action:** Update `dose_drugs.py` or create new dose normalization function.

---

#### #20. Improve PNF Lexicon from PNF Prepared
**What:** Review what transformations `prepare_drugs.py` does to PNF and bake those improvements into `pnf_lexicon` itself.

**Action:** Update PNF preparation pipeline.

---

### Phase 6: Performance

#### #10. Batch Tagging Implementation
**What:** Add `tag_batch()` method to `UnifiedTagger` that processes 10K-15K rows at once. Benchmark both sizes.

**Action:** Modify `tagger.py` to add batch processing with DuckDB bulk queries.

---

### Phase 7: Fallbacks

#### #21. FDA Food Fallback for Untagged
**What:** For Annex F rows with no drug match, tokenize and search `fda_food_*` as last resort. Same for untaggable ESOA. This is the last resort match basis.

**Action:** Add fallback matching tier using FDA food data.

---

#### #23. Dose-Flexible Tagging, Exact Matching
**What:** Confirm that:
- Part 2/3 (ATC/DrugBank tagging): dose-flexible
- Part 4 (Drug Code matching): exact dose only (drug_code is unique down to dose)

**Action:** Review and document current behavior, fix if needed.

---

### Phase 8: Cleanup

#### #19. Move Learnings to Datasets, Not Scripts
**What:** Audit all hardcoded values and migrate to reference datasets.

**Action:** Combined with #22.

---

#### #31. Update Documentation
**What:** 
- Write `pipeline.md` with all algorithmic logic, decisions, rules, principles
- Update `AGENTS.md` to reference `pipeline.md` and `implementation_plan_v2.md`
- Keep both files updated with every group of changes

**Action:** Create and maintain documentation.

---

#### #33. Track Success Metrics
**What:** Create a metrics tracking system:
- After each pipeline run, log:
  - Annex F: % with ATC, % with DrugBank ID
  - ESOA: % with ATC, % with DrugBank ID
  - ESOA→Drug Code: % matched
  - Unique generics recognized
  - Unique brands recognized
- Store in `outputs/drugs/metrics_history.csv`

**Action:** Add metrics logging to pipeline runners.
